# Puppy Adoption

![Workflow result](https://github.com/efguydan/PuppyAdoption/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
This Repository contains the code for Week 1 of the #AndroidDevChallenge. A puppy adoption application with UI written in 100% compose

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I wanted to keep the design quite simple and elegant, hence the 2 columned grid view and the simplified details page, the colors hopefully doing most of the design work.
